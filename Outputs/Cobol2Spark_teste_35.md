The provided COBOL code snippet is a part of a larger program. It is defining the environment and data division where it is assigning certain files to certain variables. However, since there is no actual data processing (like filtering, aggregation, and sorting) happening in the provided COBOL code, it's hard to provide an equivalent PySpark code.

However, if we assume that ARQPARM, ARQSORT, DIMESTIP, ARQFTP are file names, we can write a PySpark code to load these files. Here is the equivalent PySpark code:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create Spark Session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName('COBOL to PySpark') \
    .getOrCreate()

# Load files into DataFrame
df_ARQPARM = spark.read.format('csv').option('header', 'true').load('ARQPARM.csv')
df_ARQSORT = spark.read.format('csv').option('header', 'true').load('ARQSORT.csv')
df_DIMESTIP = spark.read.format('csv').option('header', 'true').load('DIMESTIP.csv')
df_ARQFTP = spark.read.format('csv').option('header', 'true').load('ARQFTP.csv')
```

Please note that in this PySpark code, we are assuming that the files are in CSV format and they have headers. If the actual files are in a different format or don't have headers, you would need to adjust the 'format' and 'option' parameters accordingly.

The provided COBOL code is quite extensive and involves a lot of data definitions and SQL operations. However, it does not contain any actual procedures or operations that manipulate the data. It seems to be a part of a larger program that is not included. 

Without the actual operations, it's impossible to provide an accurate PySpark equivalent. However, I can provide some general guidance on how you might translate some of the COBOL concepts into PySpark.

For instance, in COBOL, you might declare a table with EXEC SQL DECLARE TABLE. In PySpark, you would typically read data into a DataFrame from an existing data source. Here is an example of how you might read data from a CSV file into a DataFrame:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('example_app').getOrCreate()
df = spark.read.csv('data.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)
```

In the COBOL code, there are also numerous PIC (picture) statements that define the format of data fields. In PySpark, you would typically infer the schema automatically when you read data, or you can define it manually with `StructType` and `StructField`:

```python
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, IntegerType

schema = StructType([
    StructField("name", StringType(), True),
    StructField("age", IntegerType(), True)
])

df = spark.read.csv('data.csv', header=True, schema=schema)
```

Finally, the COBOL code contains EXEC SQL statements that perform SQL operations. In PySpark, you can perform SQL operations directly on DataFrames using methods like `select()`, `filter()`, and `groupBy()`. You can also use `createOrReplaceTempView()` to create a temporary SQL view and then use `spark.sql()` to execute SQL queries:

```python
df.createOrReplaceTempView("people")
results = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM people WHERE age > 30")
```

Without the actual operations, it's hard to provide a more specific translation. If you can provide more context or a more specific example, I would be happy to help further!

The COBOL code provided is a complex procedure that involves multiple steps such as initialization, processing, and finalization. It interacts with databases, reads and writes to files, and performs various operations on data.

Unfortunately, due to the complexity and length of the COBOL code, it is not feasible to provide an exact PySpark equivalent without a clear understanding of the underlying data schema, the database structure, and the specific business logic implemented in the code. 

However, I can provide a general outline of how the PySpark code might look, based on some assumptions about the data and the operations performed in the COBOL code:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('cobol_to_pyspark').getOrCreate()

# Load the input data
df = spark.read.format('csv').option('header', 'true').load('input.csv')

# Perform some transformations on the data
df_transformed = df.filter(col('ETP_RMO').isin([875, 876, 878])) \
    .withColumn('NUM_CGC_SORT', col('ETP_CGC')) \
    .withColumn('DATA_CANCEL_SORT', col('ETP_AMD_CANCEL')) \
    .withColumn('DATA_INIC_SORT', col('ETP_DT_INI')) \
    .withColumn('COD_CIA_SORT', col('ETP_CIA')) \
    .withColumn('COD_APOLICE_SORT', col('ETP_APOLICE')) \
    .withColumn('NOME_ESTIP_SORT', col('ETP_RSOCIAL')) \
    .withColumn('COD_ATIV_SORT', col('ETP_CODIGO_ATIV'))

# Sort the data
df_sorted = df_transformed.sort(['NUM_CGC_SORT', 'DATA_CANCEL_SORT', 'DATA_INIC_SORT', 'COD_CIA_SORT', 'COD_APOLICE_SORT'])

# Save the output data
df_sorted.write.format('csv').option('header', 'true').save('output.csv')

# Stop the SparkSession
spark.stop()
```

Please note that this PySpark code is a simplified version and does not cover all the operations performed in the original COBOL code. It assumes that the input data is in a CSV file and that the output should also be a CSV file. The data transformations and sorting operations are based on the COBOL code, but the exact logic may differ. 

For a more accurate translation, a detailed understanding of the COBOL code and the data is necessary.
