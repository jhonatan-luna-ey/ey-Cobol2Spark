Explaination of Cobol code and PySpark code:

This Cobol program performs data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) operations. The ETL process involves reading data from input files and database tables, manipulating it as per business rules, and writing it to output files.

1. Identification division: This is the first and mandatory division in a Cobol program. It provides the identification for the program. In this case, the program is identified as `DWSD0612` and is written by `CLAUDIA MARIA`.

2. Environment division: This division describes the hardware or system on which the program will run, and the files it will use. 

    1. Configuration section: It describes the system-dependent features. In this case, it specifies that the decimal point is a comma.
    2. Input-Output section: It describes the files that the Cobol program will interact with. In this case, it declares four external files: `ARQPARM`, `ARQSORT`, `DIMESTIP`, and `ARQFTP`.

3. Data Division: This division describes the data items processed in a Cobol program. It is divided into several sections:

    1. File Section: It describes the structure of the files declared in the Environment Division. Here, each file is described with its record layout.
    2. Working-Storage Section: It describes temporary variables used during the execution of the program. Variables such as counters, flags, and temporary data storage are declared here.
    3. Linkage Section: It is used to pass data from one program to another program or to pass data from a procedure to a program.

4. Procedure Division: This division contains the program logic. It reads data from the input file and database tables, filters the data based on specific conditions, sorts the data, and finally writes the data to the output files.

    1. Reading of files and tables: The program reads data from the file `ARQPARM` and from the table `ATSAUDAO.SSCESTIPULANTE`. This data is stored in the memory for processing.
    2. Data filtration based on established business rules: The program checks several conditions and filters data accordingly. For example, it checks if `DATA-PROC` is not equal to `DATA-PROX`, if `PERIODICIDADE` is equal to 'D', etc.
    3. Data sorting: The program sorts the data based on keys `NUM-CGC-SORT` and `DATA-CANCEL-SORT` in ascending order and `DATA-INIC-SORT`, `COD-CIA-SORT`, `COD-APOLICE-SORT` in descending order using the `SORT` verb.
    4. Writing data to output files: After manipulating the data, the program writes it to the output files `DIMESTIP` and `ARQFTP`.
    5. Writing of header and trailer records: The program writes header and trailer records to the file `DIMESTIP`. These records are used to provide metadata about the data file.

5. End of the code: The program execution ends with the `STOP RUN` statement. This statement causes the program to terminate.

In summary, this Cobol program reads data from an input file and a database table, processes it based on some business rules, and writes the processed data to output files. The processing involves filtering and sorting of data. The output files include metadata about the data file in the form of header and trailer records.



PySpark code:

The PySpark equivalent of the COBOL program based on the given explanation would look something like this:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Create Spark Session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DWSD0612").getOrCreate()

# Read input data
df_ARQPARM = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("ARQPARM.csv")
df_SSCESTIPULANTE = spark.read.format("jdbc").option("url", "jdbc:postgresql:dbserver").option("dbtable", "ATSAUDAO.SSCESTIPULANTE").option("user", "username").option("password", "password").load()

# Apply business rules
df_filtered = df_ARQPARM.join(df_SSCESTIPULANTE, df_ARQPARM["key"] == df_SSCESTIPULANTE["key"]).filter((col("DATA-PROC") != col("DATA-PROX")) & (col("PERIODICIDADE") == 'D'))

# Sort data
df_sorted = df_filtered.sort([col("NUM-CGC-SORT"), col("DATA-CANCEL-SORT")], ascending=[True, True]).sort([col("DATA-INIC-SORT"), col("COD-CIA-SORT"), col("COD-APOLICE-SORT")], ascending=[False, False, False])

# Write data to output files
df_sorted.write.format("csv").option("header", "true").save("DIMESTIP.csv")
df_sorted.write.format("csv").option("header", "true").save("ARQFTP.csv")

# Stop Spark Session
spark.stop()
```

This script does the following:

1. Creates a Spark session.
2. Reads the input data from the `ARQPARM.csv` file and the `ATSAUDAO.SSCESTIPULANTE` table.
3. Joins the two dataframes based on a common key and applies the business rules to filter the data.
4. Sorts the filtered data based on the specified keys.
5. Writes the sorted data to the `DIMESTIP.csv` and `ARQFTP.csv` output files.
6. Stops the Spark session.

Note: This is a simplified version of the COBOL program and does not include all the details such as the structure of the files, temporary variables, passing data from one program to another, and writing header and trailer records to the output files. These details would require additional code and are not typically handled in the same way in PySpark as they are in COBOL.
