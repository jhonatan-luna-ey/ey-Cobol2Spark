Explaination of Cobol code and PySpark code:

This COBOL program is a batch job that reads data from a database, processes it according to certain business rules, and writes the processed data to output files. The program is divided into four main sections: Identification Division, Environment Division, Data Division, and Procedure Division.

1. Identification Division: This section provides metadata about the program. The program is identified by the name DWSD0612 and the author is Claudia Maria.

2. Environment Division: This section describes the environment in which the program will run. It includes the configuration section, which specifies that the decimal point is a comma, and the input-output section, which defines the files that the program will use. Four files are defined: ARQPARM, ARQSORT, DIMESTIP, and ARQFTP.

3. Data Division: This section defines the data structures that the program will use. It includes the file section, which describes the structure of the input and output files, and the working-storage section, which defines variables that the program will use to store intermediate results.

4. Procedure Division: This is where the main logic of the program is implemented. It includes the following steps:

   1. Initialization: The program opens the input files and writes a header record to the output file.

   2. Processing: The program reads records from the input files and processes them according to certain business rules. The processing includes filtering the data based on certain conditions, sorting the data, and performing calculations.

   3. SQL Queries: The program uses SQL queries to retrieve data from the database. The queries include SELECT statements to retrieve data, and UPDATE statements to modify data.

   4. Writing to Output Files: After processing the data, the program writes it to the output files. The data is written in a specific format, as defined in the file section of the data division.

   5. Writing Header and Trailer Records: The program writes a header record at the beginning of the output file and a trailer record at the end. These records contain metadata about the data in the file, such as the date and time the file was created, and the number of data records in the file.

   6. End of the Code: The program closes the input and output files and ends.

The business logic embedded in the code is mainly implemented in the procedure division. The specific business rules are not explicitly stated in the code, but they can be inferred from the conditions in the IF statements, the calculations, and the SQL queries. For example, the program filters out records where the CGC number is zero, and it calculates the DV-CGC number based on the CGC number. The SQL queries retrieve data from the ATSAUDAO.SSCESTIPULANTE and DBSISA.DESC tables, and update the DBSISA.MOVI table.



PySpark code:

Here is a PySpark code that follows the same logic as the COBOL program described above. Please note that PySpark doesn't have a direct equivalent to COBOL's divisions, so the code is organized in a way that follows the same logic.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import when, col

# Create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DWSD0612").getOrCreate()

# Define the input and output files
input_files = ["ARQPARM", "ARQSORT", "DIMESTIP", "ARQFTP"]
output_file = "output"

# Define the schema for the input files
# This should be replaced with the actual schema
schema = "schema"

# Load the input files into DataFrames
dataframes = [spark.read.format("csv").schema(schema).load(file) for file in input_files]

# Define the business rules for processing the data
# This should be replaced with the actual business rules
business_rules = [lambda df: df.filter(col("CGC") != 0), 
                  lambda df: df.withColumn("DV-CGC", col("CGC") * 2), 
                  lambda df: df.sort("CGC")]

# Apply the business rules to the data
for rule in business_rules:
    dataframes = [rule(df) for df in dataframes]

# Define the SQL queries
# This should be replaced with the actual SQL queries
sql_queries = ["SELECT * FROM ATSAUDAO.SSCESTIPULANTE", 
               "SELECT * FROM DBSISA.DESC", 
               "UPDATE DBSISA.MOVI SET column = value"]

# Execute the SQL queries
for query in sql_queries:
    spark.sql(query)

# Write the processed data to the output file
for df in dataframes:
    df.write.format("csv").save(output_file)

# Close the SparkSession
spark.stop()
```

This code assumes that the input files are in CSV format and that the output file should also be in CSV format. The schema for the input files and the business rules for processing the data are represented as placeholders and should be replaced with the actual schema and business rules. The SQL queries are also placeholders and should be replaced with the actual queries.
