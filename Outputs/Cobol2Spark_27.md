"The code is not translatable"

The provided COBOL code does not contain any functional code to translate. It only contains environment setup and file assignments which do not have a direct equivalent in PySpark.

The provided COBOL code is a combination of data division, working-storage section and SQL statements embedded in COBOL. Here is an attempt to translate some of the COBOL operations into PySpark equivalent operations. However, please note that PySpark doesn't have a direct equivalent for many COBOL operations, especially for file handling and direct database interactions.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Create Spark Session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('cobol_to_pyspark').getOrCreate()

# Read data from file systems (replace file_path with actual file paths)
df1 = spark.read.text("file_path_for_ARQPARM")
df2 = spark.read.text("file_path_for_ARQSORT")
df3 = spark.read.text("file_path_for_ARQFTP")

# Selecting and renaming columns
df1 = df1.select(col("value").alias("REG-PARAMETRO"))
df2 = df2.select(col("value").substr(1, 12).alias("NUM-CGC-SORT"),
                 col("value").substr(13, 8).alias("DATA-CANCEL-SORT"),
                 col("value").substr(21, 8).alias("DATA-INIC-SORT"),
                 col("value").substr(29, 2).alias("NUM-DV-CGC-SORT"),
                 col("value").substr(31, 3).alias("COD-CIA-SORT"),
                 col("value").substr(34, 7).alias("COD-APOLICE-SORT"),
                 col("value").substr(41, 35).alias("NOME-ESTIP-SORT"),
                 col("value").substr(76, 4).alias("COD-ATIV-SORT"))
df3 = df3.select(col("value").alias("FTP-REGISTRO"))

# Define variables (replace with actual values where necessary)
ws_sdcdsuc = 0
ws_abend = 777
ws_sqlcode = 0
ws_qtde_subf = 0
ncob1660 = 'NCOB1660'
ln_ftp_01 = 'ANONYMOUS'
ln_ftp_02 = 'ANONYMOUS'
ln_ftp_03 = 'CD ' + ' ' * 76  # Assuming 'DIRETORIO' is empty
ln_ftp_04 = 'LCD ' + "'" + 'BS.DWSD.DWSD0619' + "'"
ln_ftp_05 = 'PUT ESTIP ESTIP.TMP'
ln_ftp_06 = 'RENAME ESTIP.TMP DWSD_ESTIP_' + ' ' * 8 + '.dat'  # Assuming 'LN-DATA' is empty
ln_ftp_07 = 'CLOSE'
ln_ftp_08 = 'QUIT'

# Further operations like reading from databases, writing to files, cursor operations, etc. are not directly 
# translatable to PySpark as PySpark does not support such operations.
```

This might not be a complete translation, but it gives an idea of how some of the COBOL operations can be translated to PySpark. PySpark does not support direct file operations, embedded SQL, or cursor operations as in COBOL. Instead, PySpark is designed to work with distributed data and dataframes. For operations that are not translatable, you might need to find an alternative approach to achieve the same result, or use a different tool or language that supports the required features.

"The code is not translatable"


Cobol's `ENVIRONMENT DIVISION` and `DATA DIVISION` sections are used to define file handling and data structures, which do not have a direct equivalent in PySpark. However, in PySpark, one generally reads and writes data to and from DataFrames.

To mimic the file control definitions in Cobol, we must translate them into code that defines how to read from and write to files. Since the Cobol snippet doesn't provide the file formats or schemas, I will assume that the files are CSV for the purpose of this translation.

Here's how you might set up PySpark to handle the files described in the Cobol code:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize a Spark session; the entry point to programming Spark with the Dataset and DataFrame API.
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("CobolToPySpark").getOrCreate()

# Replace these paths with the actual file paths or names
arqparm_path = "path/to/ARQPARM"
arqsort_path = "path/to/ARQSORT"
dimestip_path = "path/to/DIMESTIP"
arqftp_path = "path/to/ARQFTP"

# Assuming the files are CSVs, you would read them into DataFrames like this:
df_arqparm = spark.read.csv(arqparm_path, header=True, sep=",") # update the separator if a different one is used
df_arqsort = spark.read.csv(arqsort_path, header=True, sep=",")
df_dimestip = spark.read.csv(dimestip_path, header=True, sep=",")
df_arqftp = spark.read.csv(arqftp_path, header=True, sep=",")

# Process data as required...

# Saving the processed DataFrames back to files, assuming you process them into DataFrames with names like processed_df_arqparm, etc.
processed_df_arqparm.write.csv(arqparm_path, header=True)
processed_df_arqsort.write.csv(arqsort_path, header=True)
processed_df_dimestip.write.csv(dimestip_path, header=True)
processed_df_arqftp.write.csv(arqftp_path, header=True)

# Stop the Spark session when done
spark.stop()
```

In practice, Cobol file I/O is significantly different from how files are processed in distributed systems like Spark. The above code assumes a straightforward read and write of CSV files. The nuances of Cobol record structures are not reflected, and if the Cobol code includes complex record handling or file organizations, you would have to implement the equivalent logic in your PySpark processing.

Additionally, if the Cobol files are in EBCDIC format or use fixed-width records, you would need to handle these cases with custom parsing logic in PySpark. Also, "DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA" indicates that decimal values are expected to use commas as decimal points, which is typically encountered in European languages. This would require additional handling in PySpark's read options to correctly interpret such numeric values.

Please note without full Cobol processing logic it's impossible to provide an accurate translation, this example focuses only on the file I/O aspect.

Translating this COBOL code to PySpark involves converting file handling, data definitions, and SQL operations to their equivalents in a PySpark environment. However, COBOL has certain features not directly mappable to PySpark, such as the SECTIONs and paragraph names which structure the code, as well as specific file handling and computer operations. Not all COBOL functionality has a direct correlation in PySpark, so this translation will focus on the data manipulation aspects, especially involving definitions and SQL statements using DataFrames.

Below is a simplified example of how some of the COBOL data definitions might be translated to PySpark DataFrame schema definitions, and how SQL operations might be mapped using PySpark's SQL capabilities:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.types import *

# Initialize a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("CobolToPySpark").getOrCreate()

# SCHEMA DEFINITIONS
# An example of a DataFrame schema based on COBOL FD sections and WORKING-STORAGE SECTION variable definitions

# Define a schema for ARQSORT file
arqsort_schema = StructType([
    StructField("NUM_CGC_SORT", StringType(), False),
    StructField("DATA_CANCEL_SORT", StringType(), False),
    StructField("DATA_INIC_SORT", StringType(), False),
    StructField("NUM_DV_CGC_SORT", StringType(), False),
    StructField("COD_CIA_SORT", StringType(), False),
    StructField("COD_APOLICE_SORT", StringType(), False),
    StructField("NOME_ESTIP_SORT", StringType(), False),
    StructField("COD_ATIV_SORT", StringType(), False)
])

# Define a schema for DIMESTIP file
dimestip_schema = StructType([
    StructField("REG_ESTIPULANTE", StringType(), False)
])

# Define a schema for ARQFTP file
arqftp_schema = StructType([
    StructField("FTP_REGISTRO", StringType(), False)
])

# READING DATA
# Example of reading data based on FD sections, using the defined schemas
# In practice, the actual data sources would need to be the file paths read by the PySpark job

# Example of loading ARQSORT file
df_arqsort = spark.read.schema(arqsort_schema).csv("/path/to/ARQSORT.txt")

# Example of loading DIMESTIP file
df_dimestip = spark.read.schema(dimestip_schema).csv("/path/to/DIMESTIP.txt")

# Example of loading ARQFTP file
df_arqftp = spark.read.schema(arqftp_schema).csv("/path/to/ARQFTP.txt")

# SQL OPERATIONS
# An example of an SQL operation based on an EXEC SQL statement to create a DataFrame for the SSCESTIPULANTE table

# Assuming "sscestipulante" is already a table in the database to which the Spark session is connected
df_sscestipulante = spark.sql("""
SELECT ETP_CIA, ETP_APOLICE, ETP_RMO, ETP_RSOCIAL, ETP_CGC, ETP_CODIGO_ATIV, ETP_AMD_INICIO, ETP_AMD_CANCEL, ETP_DT_INI, COPER_PLANO_SAUDE
FROM ATSAUDAO.SSCESTIPULANTE
WHERE ETP_RMO IN (875, 876, 878)
""")

# ... The rest of the logic would need to be rewritten according to PySpark capabilities ...

# Terminate the Spark session after all operations are completed
spark.stop()
```
Keep in mind that the above PySpark code is overly simplified compared to the detailed logic contained within the COBOL code. A full translation would require a comprehensive understanding of the entire program's flow, including any I/O activities, business logic applied within various SECTIONs, SQL statements, and error handling. Any proprietary or system-specific commands would also need to be adapted to their PySpark equivalents or similarly functioning code.

Translating the provided COBOL code to PySpark is not a straightforward one-to-one translation, as COBOL and PySpark operate quite differently. COBOL is a procedural language typically used for file processing on mainframes, while PySpark is used for distributed data processing. Below is a simplified example to give an idea of how the COBOL code might be translated into PySpark. Note that this does not cover every detail of the COBOL code but provides a framework that can be expanded upon.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from datetime import datetime
import os

# Create Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("CobolToPySparkExample").getOrCreate()

# Example function corresponding to "100-INICIALIZACAO"
def initialize():
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    current_time = datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")
    # Additional initialization logic would be implemented here
    # ...
    return current_date, current_time

# Example function corresponding to "200-PROCESSAMENTO"
def process(df):
    # Sort and other processing logic would be implemented here
    # ...
    sorted_df = df.orderBy("num_cgc_sort", "data_cancel_sort", ascending=[True, False])
    # Continue with other processing requirements
    # ...
    return sorted_df

# Example function for finalization "500-FINALIZACAO"
def finalize():
    # Close resources, write to files, etc.
    # ...

#Example replacement for "310-ABRE-CURSOR-ATSAUDAO" and "320-LE-CURSOR-ATSAUDAO" operations
def read_from_database():
    # Instead of cursor operations, we perform a dataframe read which handles partitions
    jdbcDF = spark.read \
        .format("jdbc") \
        .option("url", "jdbc:your-db-url") \
        .option("dbtable", "schema.tablename") \
        .option("user", "username") \
        .option("password", "password") \
        .load()
    return jdbcDF

def main():
    # Perform initializations
    current_date, current_time = initialize()

    # Read from a database or input file (This would be similar to reading input file ARQPARM)
    # Below is an example of reading from a database which would replace CURSOR operations
    df = read_from_database()

    # Processing step (analogous to the COBOL SORT operations and subsequent processing)
    processed_df = process(df)

    # Finalization step
    finalize()

    # Stop the spark session
    spark.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code is a simplified example to illustrate how some COBOL constructs may translate to PySpark. Many details and fine-grained logic are omitted because they would depend on factors such as the schema of the input data, the specific operations needed to replicate the behavior of the COBOL program, and the desired format of the output data. You would need to adapt this framework to suit the specific requirements of the COBOL program you are translating.
