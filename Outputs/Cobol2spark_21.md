Explaination of Cobol code and PySpark code:

The provided COBOL code is a batch program that reads data from a database, processes it according to certain business rules, and writes the processed data to output files. The program is divided into several sections, each with a specific purpose.

1. Identification Division: This section provides basic information about the program. The program is identified by the name DWSD0612 and the author is Claudia Maria.

2. Environment Division: This section describes the environment in which the program will run. It includes the configuration section, which defines the decimal point as a comma, and the input-output section, which assigns various files to their respective identifiers.

3. Data Division: This is where all the data items used in the program are defined. It includes:
   - File Section: This section describes the structure of the files used in the program. It includes the input files (ARQPARM, ARQSORT, DIMESTIP, ARQFTP) and the output files (REG-PARAMETRO, REG-ARQSORT, REG-ESTIPULANTE, FTP-REGISTRO).
   - Working Storage Section: This section defines all the variables and constants used in the program. It includes variables for storing system information (like SQL codes), variables for storing data read from the files, and variables for storing intermediate results of the processing.
   - Linkage Section: This section is used to pass data from one program to another. In this program, it is used to pass parameters to the program.

4. Procedure Division: This is where the actual processing happens. The processing includes:
   - Start of the code: The program starts by initializing variables and opening the input and output files.
   - Reading of files and tables: The program reads data from the input files and database tables.
   - Data filtration based on established business rules: The program applies certain business rules to filter the data. For example, it checks if the data is within a certain date range.
   - Data sorting: The program sorts the data based on certain criteria.
   - Extracting all queries SQL: The program uses SQL queries to extract data from the database.
   - Writing data to output files: The program writes the processed data to the output files.
   - Writing of header and trailer records: The program writes header and trailer records to the output files. These records contain metadata about the data in the file, such as the date and time the file was created.
   - End of the code: The program closes all the files and ends.

5. End of the code: This is the end of the program. The program stops running at this point.

In summary, this COBOL program reads data from a database and input files, processes the data according to certain business rules, and writes the processed data to output files. The program is well-structured and follows good programming practices, making it easy to understand and maintain.



PySpark code:

Based on the provided COBOL program explanation, here is a simplified PySpark code that performs similar operations:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import *

# Create Spark Session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DWSD0612").getOrCreate()

# Define input and output files
input_files = ["ARQPARM", "ARQSORT", "DIMESTIP", "ARQFTP"]
output_files = ["REG-PARAMETRO", "REG-ARQSORT", "REG-ESTIPULANTE", "FTP-REGISTRO"]

# Define variables and constants
variables = {}
constants = {}

# Read data from input files
for file in input_files:
    variables[file] = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load(file)

# Apply business rules and filter data
for file in input_files:
    variables[file] = variables[file].filter(col("date").between("start_date", "end_date"))

# Sort data
for file in input_files:
    variables[file] = variables[file].sort("sort_column")

# Extract data using SQL queries
for file in input_files:
    variables[file].createOrReplaceTempView(file)
    variables[file] = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM " + file)

# Write data to output files
for file in output_files:
    variables[file].write.format("csv").option("header", "true").save(file)

# Write header and trailer records
for file in output_files:
    with open(file, 'a') as f:
        f.write("Header: " + str(variables[file].count()) + "\n")
        f.write("Trailer: " + str(variables[file].count()) + "\n")

# Close Spark Session
spark.stop()
```

Please note that this is a simplified version of the COBOL program and does not include all the details. For example, the business rules for filtering and sorting the data, the SQL queries for extracting the data, and the structure of the header and trailer records are not specified in the explanation, so they are not included in the code.
