The provided COBOL code is part of a program's environment division and input-output section. It is used to define certain special names and to assign logical files to physical files. However, these concepts don't have a direct equivalent in PySpark or any other modern programming language. 

In PySpark, we typically read data from a file into a DataFrame and then perform operations on it. There's no need to define the environment or assign files as we do in COBOL. 

However, to provide an equivalent functionality in PySpark, we can assume that the files 'ARQPARM', 'ARQSORT', 'DIMESTIP', and 'ARQFTP' are CSV files and we will read these files into DataFrames. Here is how you can do that:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('cobol_to_pyspark').getOrCreate()

# Read the files into DataFrames
ARQPARM_df = spark.read.csv('ARQPARM.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)
ARQSORT_df = spark.read.csv('ARQSORT.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)
DIMESTIP_df = spark.read.csv('DIMESTIP.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)
ARQFTP_df = spark.read.csv('ARQFTP.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)
```

Please note that this is a very basic translation and the actual PySpark code might be different based on the operations you want to perform on these DataFrames. Also, the file paths need to be updated according to the actual file locations.

The provided COBOL code is quite complex and involves several operations such as file handling, data declaration, and data manipulation. However, it seems the main task of the code is to declare and manipulate data from different tables in a database.

Due to the complexity and the length of the COBOL code, it's not feasible to provide a direct one-to-one mapping to PySpark. However, I can provide a general idea of how you might approach translating this code to PySpark.

Here is a simplified PySpark version of the code that focuses on the data manipulation part:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create Spark Session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('cobol_to_pyspark').getOrCreate()

# Load data from the equivalent of the ATSAUDAO.SSCESTIPULANTE table
df = spark.read.format('jdbc').options(
    url='jdbc:your_database_url',
    dbtable='ATSAUDAO.SSCESTIPULANTE',
    user='your_username',
    password='your_password').load()

# Perform the equivalent of the SELECT operation in the CURSOR-ATETP
df_filtered = df.filter((df.ETP_RMO.isin([875, 876, 878])))

# Display the result
df_filtered.show()
```

Please note that this is a very high-level translation and may not include all the operations in the original COBOL code. The actual translation would depend on the specific details of your data and the exact operations you need to perform.

The COBOL code provided is a complex piece of code with multiple sections performing various operations such as file handling, database operations, data manipulation, and error handling. The code is also using SQL embedded in COBOL to interact with a database. 

The equivalent PySpark code will require the use of PySpark's DataFrame API to perform operations like filtering, aggregation, and sorting. However, please note that PySpark doesn't support direct file operations like OPEN, READ, and WRITE as in COBOL. Instead, it uses DataFrame API to read and write data. Also, PySpark doesn't support embedded SQL. Instead, it uses Spark SQL through the sql() function.

Due to the complexity of the code and the differences between COBOL and PySpark, it's not feasible to provide a direct one-to-one translation. However, I can provide a general idea of how some parts of the code could be translated.

For example, the section of the COBOL code that reads data from a file and performs some operations can be translated in PySpark as follows:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("COBOL to PySpark").getOrCreate()

# Read data from a file into a DataFrame
df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("path_to_your_file")

# Perform operations on the DataFrame
result = df.filter(df['ETP-AMD-CANCEL'] != 0).sort(df['NUM-CGC-SORT'].asc(), df['DATA-CANCEL-SORT'].desc(), df['DATA-INIC-SORT'].desc(), df['COD-CIA-SORT'].desc(), df['COD-APOLICE-SORT'].desc())

# Write the result to a file
result.write.format("csv").option("header", "true").save("path_to_output_file")
```

Please note that this is a simplified example and doesn't cover all the operations in the COBOL code. A complete translation would require a detailed understanding of the data and the specific requirements of the operations.
