The PySpark code provided is correct and equivalent to the COBOL code. The COBOL code is defining file controls and assigning them to variables. The PySpark code is doing the same by reading in CSV files and assigning them to DataFrame variables. 

However, the PySpark code could be improved by adding error handling and checking if the files exist before trying to read them. Here's the improved PySpark code:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
import os

# Create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("COBOL to PySpark").getOrCreate()

# Define the file paths
ARQPARM_path = "path_to_ARQPARM_file"
ARQSORT_path = "path_to_ARQSORT_file"
DIMESTIP_path = "path_to_DIMESTIP_file"
ARQFTP_path = "path_to_ARQFTP_file"

# Check if the files exist before trying to read them
if os.path.exists(ARQPARM_path) and os.path.exists(ARQSORT_path) and os.path.exists(DIMESTIP_path) and os.path.exists(ARQFTP_path):
    # Read the data from the files
    ARQPARM_df = spark.read.csv(ARQPARM_path, inferSchema=True, header=True)
    ARQSORT_df = spark.read.csv(ARQSORT_path, inferSchema=True, header=True)
    DIMESTIP_df = spark.read.csv(DIMESTIP_path, inferSchema=True, header=True)
    ARQFTP_df = spark.read.csv(ARQFTP_path, inferSchema=True, header=True)

    # Print the data
    ARQPARM_df.show()
    ARQSORT_df.show()
    DIMESTIP_df.show()
    ARQFTP_df.show()
else:
    print("One or more files do not exist.")
```

This code now checks if the files exist before trying to read them, preventing potential errors. If one or more files do not exist, it prints a message instead of trying to read the files.

The PySpark code provided does not fully replicate the functionality of the given COBOL code. The COBOL code is more than just reading data from a database, it includes a lot of data manipulation and processing steps. The PySpark code only reads data from a database and filters it, which is not enough.

Here is a more equivalent PySpark code:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import when, lit

# Create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("COBOL to PySpark").getOrCreate()

# Define the database connection parameters
database_url = "jdbc:your_database_url"
username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"

# Read the data from the database
df_at_audao = spark.read.format('jdbc').options(
    url=database_url,
    dbtable='ATSAUDAO.SSCESTIPULANTE',
    user=username,
    password=password).load()

# Filter the data
df_filtered = df_at_audao.filter(df_at_audao['ETP_RMO'].isin([875, 876, 878]))

# Data manipulation and processing steps
# Note: The following steps are just placeholders, replace them with actual steps based on your requirements
df_processed = df_filtered.withColumn("new_column", df_filtered["existing_column"] + 1)
df_processed = df_processed.withColumnRenamed("old_name", "new_name")
df_processed = df_processed.drop("column_to_drop")

# Write the processed data to a file
df_processed.write.csv("path_to_output_file")

# Stop the SparkSession
spark.stop()
```

Please note that this is a very simplified version and does not cover all the steps in the COBOL code. You need to replace the placeholders in the data manipulation and processing steps with the actual steps based on your requirements. Also, the COBOL code seems to be dealing with some error handling and other functionalities which are not covered in this PySpark code.

The PySpark code provided is a simplified version of the COBOL code. It reads a CSV file, performs a filter operation, sorts the data, and then writes the result to a new CSV file. However, it does not cover all the functionality present in the COBOL code. 

The COBOL code is more complex and involves multiple files, more detailed data manipulation, and error handling. It also involves specific data structures and operations such as cursors, fetch, and SQL operations which are not directly represented in the PySpark code.

Here is a more detailed PySpark code that could cover more functionality from the COBOL code. Note that this is a simplified version and does not cover all the details, especially error handling and specific SQL operations:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, asc, desc

# Create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName('Translate COBOL to PySpark') \
    .getOrCreate()

# Define the file paths
ARQPARM_path = "path_to_ARQPARM_file"
ARQSORT_path = "path_to_ARQSORT_file"
DIMESTIP_path = "path_to_DIMESTIP_file"
ARQFTP_path = "path_to_ARQFTP_file"

# Read the data from the files
ARQPARM_df = spark.read.csv(ARQPARM_path, inferSchema=True, header=True)
ARQSORT_df = spark.read.csv(ARQSORT_path, inferSchema=True, header=True)
DIMESTIP_df = spark.read.csv(DIMESTIP_path, inferSchema=True, header=True)
ARQFTP_df = spark.read.csv(ARQFTP_path, inferSchema=True, header=True)

# Perform some transformations (e.g., filtering and sorting)
ARQPARM_filtered = ARQPARM_df.filter(col('ETP_RMO').isin([875, 876, 878]))
ARQSORT_sorted = ARQPARM_filtered.sort(asc('NUM-CGC-SORT'), asc('DATA-CANCEL-SORT'), desc('DATA-INIC-SORT'), asc('COD-CIA-SORT'), asc('COD-APOLICE-SORT'))

# Write the transformed data to a new file
ARQSORT_sorted.write.csv('DIMESTIP.csv')

# Stop the SparkSession
spark.stop()
```

Please note that this is a simplified version and does not cover all the details from the COBOL code. The COBOL code involves more complex operations and error handling which are not directly represented in PySpark.
